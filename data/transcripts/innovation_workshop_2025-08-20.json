      "text": "Climate technology is advancing rapidly, but we need more young voices in the conversation. The funding gap for climate startups is still significant - about 2 billion euros globally."
    },
    {
      "timestamp": "10:05",
      "speaker": "Sofia Patel", 
      "text": "As a young entrepreneur, I can confirm that funding is our biggest barrier. My renewable energy project needs 200K euros to reach the next milestone, but traditional investors don't understand our vision."
    },
    {
      "timestamp": "10:08",
      "speaker": "Miguel Torres",
      "text": "That's where programs like YSI become crucial. We need to create ecosystems that support young innovators not just with money, but with mentorship and recognition."
    },
    {
      "timestamp": "10:12",
      "speaker": "Ana Silva",
      "text": "Let's dive deeper into the three pillars: Capital, Recognition, and Wellbeing. Sofia, how has the lack of capital affected your project timeline?"
    },
    {
      "timestamp": "10:15",
      "speaker": "Sofia Patel",
      "text": "Without proper funding, I've had to bootstrap everything. My wellbeing has suffered - working 80-hour weeks isn't sustainable. Recognition would help attract investors."
    },
    {
      "timestamp": "10:18",
      "speaker": "David Kim",
      "text": "This highlights the interconnected nature of the three pillars. Success requires all three working together - capital enables innovation, recognition attracts more capital, and wellbeing ensures sustainable growth."

    {
      "timestamp": "10:25",
      "speaker": "Miguel Torres",
      "text": "For the action items, I suggest we create a climate-focused track within YSI, with dedicated funding and mentorship for environmental solutions."
