# Global Insights Dashboard

## Overview

The Global Insights dashboard provides a comprehensive view of **Problems** and **Proposals** identified across all co-creation sessions, organized by the three strategic pillars of the Youth & Social Innovation Charter.

## Data Flow

### Mock Data Structure

Located in `src/data/mockInsights.ts`:

```typescript
{
  pillars: [
    {
      pillar: 'capital_access',
      problems: [...],
      proposals: [...]
    },
    // ... other pillars
  ]
}
```

Each insight item includes:
- `canonical_text`: The main phrasing
- `aliases`: List of alternative phrasings
- `count`: Number of distinct documents
- `weighted_count`: Recency-adjusted score
- `supporting_docs`: Array of documents with citations
- `breakdowns`: Regional, temporal, and stakeholder data

### Types

Located in `src/types/insights.ts`:

- `InsightItem`: Core data structure for problems/proposals
- `DocEvidence`: Document with sentence-level citations
- `Citation`: Individual quote with metadata
- `Pillar`: Union type of the 3 pillars
- `SortOption`: Sorting methods

## Usage

### Accessing the Dashboard

1. Navigate to the **Dashboard** tab (main navigation)
2. Click on the **Global Insights** sub-tab
3. Select a pillar from the left sidebar
4. Browse problems and proposals in the dual leaderboards
5. Click "View Evidence" on any card to see supporting documents

### Navigation Flow

```
App.tsx
  ‚îî‚îÄ Dashboard Tab
      ‚îî‚îÄ Sub-tabs: [Shapers Network | Global Insights]
          ‚îî‚îÄ Global Insights
              ‚îú‚îÄ Sidebar: Select pillar
              ‚îú‚îÄ Leaderboard: Browse problems/proposals
              ‚îî‚îÄ Drawer: View evidence (on demand)
```

## Responsive Design

- **Desktop (‚â•1024px)**: Sidebar + dual-column leaderboards
- **Tablet (768-1023px)**: Sidebar + single-column leaderboards (stacked)
- **Mobile (<768px)**: Full-width, collapsible sidebar

## Future Enhancements (Phase 2+)

- [ ] Sparklines for 30/90-day trends
- [ ] Compare mode (juxtapose problems ‚Üî proposals)
- [ ] Export to CSV/JSON
- [ ] Pin to watchlist
- [ ] Pending review workflow
- [ ] Create Commitment wizard (seed drafts from evidence)
- [ ] Real-time updates (replace mock data with API)
- [ ] Collaborative features (comments, voting)
- [ ] Time machine view (historical leaderboards)

## Styling

Uses existing YSI color palette:
- Primary: `#0077B6` (blue)
- Secondary: `#C3B1E1` (purple)
- Accent: `#A8E6CF` (green)
- Background gradient: `white ‚Üí #E8F1F9`

Components leverage:
- shadcn/ui primitives (Card, Badge, Button, Sheet, Tabs)
- Lucide React icons
- Tailwind CSS utilities

## Performance Considerations

- Virtualized lists (for large datasets in Phase 2+)
- Lazy loading of breakdowns
- Debounced search (future feature)
- Pagination in evidence drawer (if >20 docs)
